Initial UX:
- Firefox browser is open automatically in restore mode. It should be maximized.
- The screen has horizontal scrolling no matter how much the screen is zoomed.
- When test is done the firefox is close. User can only view result with the next run.
- when test is run manually from a tab on firefox, it still close that whole browser.
When user does not select any option the screen closes, and user needs to go the terminal to see what's going on. There should be validation/user prompts on screen.

In App UX and UI:
- The UI is not user friendly.
- Missing navigation, when viewing result detail. Also, there should be better navigation on main page as well.
- Each test suites presented may contain a lot of tests. Each main tests should view number of sub tests. It would be greater to also state time consumption too.
- Past run test results should be below new buttons somewhere. Their list item information should be better organized too.
- Start new run "Go" should be changed to a button with text like "Run New Test".
- Options for running new test can be group and display in a modal box after click "Run New Test".
- "Cancel" button should be changed to "Exit" or "Close" as the way it behaves.
- In page title, it says "Iris Control Center", so the page should have a proper header and footer, plus maybe a logo. However, this might not be necessary if this tool is going to be embeded in the the browser or another application.

Functionality:
- Some tests failed when run single test e.g. add_links_keyboard_shortcuts.
- Some feature not working or not instructed how it works e.g. "Email Results" which email address is the email sent to?
